        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Iraj Tambat. I am a student at Michigan State University with a passion for UI and UX. I grew up in Sterling Heights Michigan. Being in Michigan meant going to the Detroit auto show. Surprisingly, this is where I fell in love with UI and UX design. I saw many cars with different UI designs and how some were hard to understand.
